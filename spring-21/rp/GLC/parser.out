Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . statement
    (1) statement -> . ZERO statement ONE
    (2) statement -> . ZERO ONE

    ZERO            shift and go to state 2

    statement                      shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> statement .



state 2

    (1) statement -> ZERO . statement ONE
    (2) statement -> ZERO . ONE
    (1) statement -> . ZERO statement ONE
    (2) statement -> . ZERO ONE

    ONE             shift and go to state 4
    ZERO            shift and go to state 2

    statement                      shift and go to state 3

state 3

    (1) statement -> ZERO statement . ONE

    ONE             shift and go to state 5


state 4

    (2) statement -> ZERO ONE .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (statement -> ZERO ONE .)
    ONE             reduce using rule 2 (statement -> ZERO ONE .)


state 5

    (1) statement -> ZERO statement ONE .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (statement -> ZERO statement ONE .)
    ONE             reduce using rule 1 (statement -> ZERO statement ONE .)
